# Notable new features

-   Pressing `Ctrl-Alt-V` in the REPL now enters a mode where the name of the
    next key pressed will be inserted into the buffer.

-   The `epm` module no longer depends on Unix commands like `mkdir` and is now
    compatible with a stock Windows installation. It still depends on commands
    needed for downloading packages (typically `git` or `rsync`).

# Notable bugfixes

-   The `lower` glob modifier (as in `echo *[lower]`) now correctly matches
    lower-case letters. It used to match digits by mistake.

# Deprecations

# Breaking changes

-   If you are upgrading from a version older than 0.14.0, make sure that you
    close all Elvish processes running the old version before starting any new
    ones.

    This is because the logic for determining how to connect to daemon has
    changed and is no longer backward compatible with versions older than
    0.14.0.
