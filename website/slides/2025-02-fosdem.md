<!-- This talk is similar in scope to 2024-11-golab.md, but with the following main changes:

- The interpreter implementation part is trimmed
- The CI/CD part moved to the front
- A vision section
-->

***

# Intro

-   The programming language and shell this talk is about

    -   Elvish <https://elv.sh>

-   How is a shell different from a terminal?

    -   The first program that runs in your terminal

    -   Think the "homepage" in a browser

-   Like bash / zsh / ..., but more modern

    -   More powerful interactive features

    -   Full-fledged programming language

    -   Other modern shells: [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh),
        [Oils](https://www.oilshell.org), [Murex](https://murex.rocks)

-   Why make a shell?

    -   Make my own tool

    -   Help others make their own tools

***

# Full-fledged programming language

-   Some think advanced programming features and shell scripting are
    incompatible

-   But real programming features are great for shell scripting!

    ```elvish
    # [foo bar] - list
    # [&key=value] - map
    var hosts = [[&name=a &cmd='apt update']
                 [&name=b &cmd='pacman -Syu']]
    # peach = "parallel each"
    # {|h| ...} - lambda
    peach {|h| ssh root@$h[name] $h[cmd] } $hosts
    ```

-   Elvish has all the familiar shell features too

    ```elvish
    vim main.go
    cat *.go | wc -l
    # Elvish also supports recursive wildcards
    cat **.go | wc -l
    ```

***

# Elvish is complementary to Go

-   Elvish's continuous deployment pipeline (<https://github.com/elves/up>):

    ![Continuous deployment pipeline](./2024-08-rc-implementation/cd.svg)

    -   Go is a great language to write a web server with

    -   Elvish is a great language for scripting

***

# Interactive features

-   Great out-of-the-box experience (demo)

    -   Syntax highlighting

    -   Completion with <kbd>Tab</kbd>

    -   Directory history with <kbd>Ctrl-L</kbd>

    -   Command history with <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd>

    -   Filesystem navigator with <kbd>Ctrl-N</kbd>

-   Programmable

    ```elvish
    set edit:prompt = { print (whoami)@(tilde-abbr $pwd)'$ ' }
    ```

-   Soon the entire UI will be programmable with a new TUI framework

***

# Building Elvish with Go

***

# Data types

-   Go `bool` and `string`

-   Numbers: Go's primitive number types (`int`, `float64`) and big number types
    ([`big.Int`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Int),
    [`big.Rat`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Rat)):

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> * (range 1 41) # 40!
    ▶ (num 815915283247897734345611269596115894272000000000)
    ~> + 1/10 2/10
    ▶ (num 3/10)
    ```

-   Elvish has its own list and map implementations (modelled after Clojure)

***

# Standard library

-   Elvish's `math:` ← Go's [`math`](https://pkg.go.dev/math):

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> math:log10 100
    ▶ (num 2.0)
    ```

-   Elvish's `str:` ← Go's [`strings`](https://pkg.go.dev/strings):

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> str:has-prefix foobar foo
    ▶ $true
    ```

-   Elvish's `re:` ← Go's [`regexp`](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp):

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> re:match '^foo' foobar
    ▶ $true
    ```

***

# Implementing pipeline semantics (1)

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

-   ```elvish
    echo $pid | wc
    ```

-   Get parsed and "compiled" into:

    ![Op tree](./2024-08-rc-implementation/op-tree.svg)

    <!--
    digraph optree {
        node [shape = rectangle];
        edge [arrowhead = none];
        "Pipeline" [label = "pipelineOp"];
        "Form echo" [label = "formOp"];
        "Form wc" [label = "formOp"];
        "Expr echo" [label = <<b>variableOp</b><br/>Scope=<b>Builtin</b><br/>Name=<b>"echo~"</b>>];
        "Expr $pid" [label = <variableOp<br/>Scope=<b>Builtin</b><br/>Name="pid">];
        "Expr wc" [label = <<b>literalOp</b><br/>Value=<b>ExternalCmd{"wc"}</b>>];

        "Pipeline" -> "Form echo" [label = "Form"];
        "Form echo" -> "Expr echo" [label = "Head"];
        "Form echo" -> "Expr $pid" [label = "Arg"];
        "Pipeline" -> "Form wc" [label = "Form"];
        "Form wc" -> "Expr wc" [label = "Head"];
    }
    -->

</div>
<div class="column">

-   The `echo` command and the `wc` command execute within different
    **contexts**:

    ```go
    type Context struct {
        stdinFile *os.File
        stdinChan <-chan any
        stdoutFile *os.File
        stdoutChan chan<- any
    }

    func (op *pipelineOp) exec(*Context) { ... }
    func (op *formOp) exec(*Context) { ... }
    ```

</div>
</div>

***

# Implementing pipeline semantics (2)

```go
type pipelineOp struct { forms []formOp }

func (op *pipelineOp) exec(ctx *Context) {
    form1, form2 := forms[0], forms[1] // Assume 2 forms
    r, w, _ := os.Pipe()               // Byte pipeline
    ch := make(chan any, 1024)         // Channel pipeline
    ctx1 := ctx.cloneWithStdout(w, ch) // Context for form 1
    ctx2 := ctx.cloneWithStdin(r, ch)  // Context for form 2
    var wg sync.WaitGroup              // Now execute them in parallel!
    wg.Add(2)
    go func() { form1.exec(ctx1); wg.Done() }()
    go func() { form2.exec(ctx2); wg.Done() }()
    wg.Wait()
}
```

***

# Go is a decent language to write a shell in

-   Free data types and standard library

-   Good primitives for pipeline semantics

-   Free garbage collection

# Testing Elvish

# Test strategy

-   Testing is important

    -   Gives us confidence about the correctness of the code

    -   Especially when changing the code

-   Most important thing about your test strategy

    -   Make it *really* easy to create and maintain tests

    -   Easy-to-write tests ⇒ more tests ⇒ higher test coverage

    -   Elvish has 92% test coverage

-   Interpreters have a super simple API!

    -   Input: code

    -   Output: text, values

        ```elvish-transcript
        ~> echo hello world
        hello world
        ~> put [hello world] [foo bar]
        ▶ [hello world]
        ▶ [foo bar]
        ```

***

# Iteration 1: table-driven tests

```go
// Simplified interpreter API
func Interpret(code string) ([]any, string)

var tests = []struct{
    code string
    wantValues []any
    wantText   string
}{
    {code: "echo foo", wantText: "foo\n"},
}

func TestInterpreter(t *testing.T) {
    for _, test := range tests {
        gotValues, gotText := Interpret(test.code)
        // Compare with test.wantValues and test.wantText
    }
}
```

***

# Adding a test case with table-driven tests

-   Steps:

    1.  Implement new functionality

    2.  Test manually in terminal:

        ```elvish-transcript
        ~> str:join , [a b]
        ▶ 'a,b'
        ```

    3.  Convert the interaction into a test case:

        ```go
        {code: "str:join , [a b]", wantValues: []any{"a,b"}}
        ```

-   Step 3 can get repetitive

    -   Computers are good at repetitive tasks 🤔

***

# Iteration 2: transcript tests

-   Record terminal *transcripts* in `tests.elvts`:

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> str:join , [a b]
    ▶ 'a,b'
    ```

-   Generate the table from the terminal transcript:

    ```go
    //go:embed tests.elvts
    const transcripts string

    func TestInterpreter(t *testing.T) {
        tests := parseTranscripts(transcripts)
        for _, test := range tests { /* ... */ }
    }
    ```

-   Embrace text format

    -   We lose strict structure, but it doesn't matter in practice

***

# Adding a test case with transcript tests

-   Steps:

    1.  Implement new functionality

    2.  Test manually in terminal:

        ```elvish-transcript
        ~> str:join , [a b]
        ▶ 'a,b'
        ```

    3.  Copy the terminal transcript into `tests.elvts`

-   Copying is still work

    -   What if we don't even need to copy? 🤔

***

# Iteration 2.1: an editor extension for transcript tests

-   Editor extension for `.elvts` files

    -   Run code under cursor

    -   Insert output below cursor

-   Steps (demo):

    1.  Implement new functionality

    2.  Test manually in `tests.elvts` within the editor:

        ```elvish-transcript
        ~> use str
        ~> str:join , [a b]
        ▶ 'a,b'
        ```

-   We have eliminated test writing as a separate step during development!

***

# Testing the terminal app

-   Like GUI apps, Elvish's terminal app is made up of *widgets*

-   Example: `TextArea` and how to test it

    1.  Press <kbd>x</kbd>, press <kbd>y</kbd>, render and check

    2.  Press <kbd>Left</kbd>, render and check

    3.  Press <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, render and check

***

# Leveraging Elvish and transcript tests!

-   Create Elvish bindings for the widget

    -   A `send` command to emulate keyboard events

    -   A `render` command to show the current UI

-   Demo:

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> send [e c o]; render
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │eco                                     │
    │RRR ̅̂                                    │
    └────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ...
    ```

-   Look a lot like screenshots tests!

    -   With "screenshots" embedded directly in test files

***

# Testing strategy recap

-   Make testing easy

-   Embrace DSLs, embrace text

    -   If DSLs don't solve your problem, you're not using enough of it

-   Prior art: [Mercurial's tests](https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/WritingTests)

***

# Vision for the future of the shell

-   Shell languages as languages for real personal computing

-   Use shell to manage personal servers, build simple CI/CD pipelines, not YAML

-   Use shell to build little UIs tailored to your need

-   Break free from the terminal
